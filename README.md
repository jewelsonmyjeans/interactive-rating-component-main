### What I learned

I finally used SCSS in a project and honestly it's very easy to use and think it makes writing css so much easier.

### Continued development

Honestly, I've barely made Javascript projects and this being one of the first I've done all by myself without much searching and all from what I already know and it gave me a good sense of good I am at learning things and in the future I'd like to make something like this again but much better.
